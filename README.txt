 4.0 Directory Setup
---------------------------------
The source code of ActiviLog is mostly contained within the client and server directories located in the base directory that was 
downloaded following instructions in Section 3.1. 

The client directory contains primarily frontend elements:
* A directory called "pages" which contains the JavaScript files that handle the dynamic frontend display rendering using ReactJS.
* A directory called "common" which contains directories for images, stylesheets, client-side JavaScript that has unrestricted access. 
Common React JS components were made for display elements such as Footers and Headers which can also be found in this directory.
* A file called "api.js" this works as an intermidiate point between the client side pages and the backend. 
* A file called "index.html" that is used to render the views in.
* A file called "app.js" that handles routing in the frontend.

The server directory contains primarily backend elements:
* A directory called "models" which holds information about the Mongoose schemas for the database. 
* A file called "server.js" communicates with the database, handles all the session management and authentication of users.
* A file called "router.js" handles communications between the frontend and the backend. 

The bin directory contains:
* A single file called "www" which creates the httpServer and is called on start up.
